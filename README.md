Learning how to use github

My intention is to learn as much as I can so I will have the skills neccesary to build a swath of directory websites. This will enabke me to work remotly from anywhere in the world. This appeals to me because I have a new baby and a 3 month trip to Ireland planned in the summer. GO NOMAD!!
